    <h1>Aestus MEV-Boost Relay</h1>

    <p>The Aestus MEV-Boost Relay is a neutral, non-censoring block relay for Ethereum proof-of-stake valiators.</p>

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

    <p>MEV is likely to remain an important component of returns generated by those engaged in ethereum PoS staking. The Aestus relay project developed out of conversations between members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/">ethfinance</a> and <a href="https://www.ethstaker.cc/">EthStaker</a> communities who see the need to develop credibly neutral architecture for the Ethereum staking ecosystem.</p>

    <p>There is currently a significant lack of diversity within the ethereum MEV relay space. Despite their contributions to the community, current relays are managed by companies and projects with direct financial interests in MEV and related revenue streams. Opaque relationships between relays, searchers and builders make it difficult for stakers to decide which relays to use or trust.</p>

    <p>The Aestus relay is MEV infrastructure which we offer to the community as a public good, free from any commercial interest and aligned to principles of credible neutrality:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Censorship resistant:</strong> Any relays or other architecture will never censor or filter transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-judgemental:</strong> Will never exclude or promote specific types of MEV searcher strategy</li>
      <li><strong>Nonprofit:</strong> Will never profit indirectly or directly from MEV.</li>
      <li><strong>Unbiased:</strong> Will never compete with or make exclusive relationships with builders and searchers</li>
      <li><strong>Open source:</strong> Any software or modifications to existing projects will be published for all to see.</li>
    </ul>
